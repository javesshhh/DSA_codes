// https://www.callicoder.com/minimum-difference-element-in-sorted-array/#:~:text=Given%20an%20array%20of%20integers,'5'%20is%20the%20minimum.

// Think about approach given below it may help:
// floor : end pointer after the whole execution of loop,if mid is not exist.
// ceil : start pointer after the whole execution of loop,if mid is not exist.

// If you analyze the start and end indices point to the numbers that are closest to the target value being searched for.
// at the end of the loop, the start index points to the ceiling of the target and the end index points to the floor of the target value.
// If we find the target, then we return it as the minimum difference element.
// If we canâ€™t,  then at the end of the loop, we can find the differences between the target and
// the numbers at indices start and end, as these two numbers will be closest to the target.
// The number that gives minimum difference will be the output.
