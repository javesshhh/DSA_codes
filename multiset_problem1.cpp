// Our Monk loves candy !
// While taking a stroll in the park , he stumbled upon N Bags with candies . The i'th of these bags contains A‚ÇÅ
// candies .
// He picks up a bag , eats all the candies in it and drops it on the ground . But as soon as he drops the bag , the
// number of candies in the bag increases magically ! Say the bag that used to contain X candies ( before eating ) ,
// now contains [ X / 2 ] candies ! , where [ x ] is the greatest integer less than x ( Greatest Integer Function ) .
// Amazed by the magical spell , Monk can now have a lot more candies ! But he has to return home in K minutes .
// In a single minute , Monk can consume all the candies in a single bag , regardless of the number of candies in it .
// Find the maximum number of candies that Monk can consume .
